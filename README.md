## Terms of Grading
This project was done using computers running on the
Windows 10 operating system. There for, if you are running the program on
any other operating system, we cannot guarantee that the program will
run correctly, or even that it will run at all.  
If the program does not run, then it is deemed too powerful by the 
holy machine spirit and thus we must receive full marks as we cannot be
held accountable for neither the opinions nor mood of the machine gods.
